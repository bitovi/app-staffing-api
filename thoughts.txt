IF SCAFFOLD, WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE

- CODE GENERATION IN THE SIMPLEST SYNTAX POSSIBLE

STEPS
-> WRITE YOUR SCAFFOLD(SCHEMA). THIS WILL REPRESENT THE MODEL ON THE DATABASE AND THE COMPONENTS ON THE CLIENT.
-> USE A CLI TOOL TO SCAFFOLD THE SCHEMA INTO AN ORM(Sequelize, objection, ) OF CHOICE / LIBRARY OF CHOICE(EXPRESS/ KOA)
-> WHAT IT OFFERS
    -> SPEED WITH KICKSTARTING PROJECT
    -> PROJECT STRUCTURE
    -> SEEDING IN THE DATABASE(OPTIONAL)
    -> AUTHENTICATION/AUTHORIZATION CODE GENERATED.
-> CODE GENERATION WORKS BECAUSE IT ONLY KICKSTARTS YOUR PROJECT, IF YOU EVER NEED TO CHANGE YOUR SCHEMA, YOU CHANGE FROM THE MODEL OR COMPONENTS PROPS
 NOT FROM THE KICKSTARTING SCHEMA.

SCHEMA

scaffold/app.ts

interface IStatus {
    "up"
    "down"
}

APPS
view -> table
routes -> "CRUD"
attributes {
    id -> uuid, view : false, db: true
    name -> string, 
    status -> string, enum: true, 
    noOfHosts -> number, virtual, aggregate: db, include: ["hosts"], get: (this.hosts) { return sum(this.hosts) }
    healthyHosts: number, virtual, aggregate: client, include: ["hosts"], get: (this.hosts) { return average(this.hosts) }
}
relationship -> {
    oneToMany -> ["hosts", "pots"]
}

scaffold/host.js
view -> table
routes - > "R"
attributes {
    id -> uuid, 
    name: string, view: false 
    location: string, view: false,
    namedLocation: string, db: false, get: (this.name, this.location) { return `${this.name}--${this.location}` }
    appId: string, link: App, attributes: ["name", "status"] 
}
relationship -> {
    belongsToOne -> ["App"]
}

- IT GENERATES A CODE WITH A CLIENT SIDE AND A SERVER SIDE.
-> npx scaffold generate -server express -orm sequelize -client react -seed true -useScaffoldCrudHandler true 
-> npx scaffold seed -name hosts -no 30 -exclude healthyHosts.

- THE other ADVANTAGES OF SCAFFOLD SUCH AS Parsing and serializing should also remain.

-> A PLUS
Transition from one ORM TO ANOTHER ORM Using scaffold
-> FROM Scaffold -> ORM(Sequelize/ Objection).
-> FROM ORM -> SCAFFOLD
-> FROM ORM1 -> SCAFFOLD -> ORM2.


It's a lot to build...
